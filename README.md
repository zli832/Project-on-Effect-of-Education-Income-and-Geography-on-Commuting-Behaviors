## Effect of Education, Income, and Geography on Commuting Behaviors

•⁠ Project: Data pipeline& Dashboard + Statistical Model with Python
•⁠ Duration: Feb 2025 - May 2025
•⁠ Team Members: Lucas Li, Reese Yang, Max Migdon

###💻Background

This project investigates how socioeconomic factors—specifically education level, income, and geographical characteristics—influence commuting behaviors in the United States. Using microdata from the IPUMS American Community Survey (ACS), this analysis explores patterns in commute time, travel mode, and work hours across demographic groups.

The goal is to understand the determinants of commuting burden and mobility behavior, which are relevant for urban planning, labor economics, and public policy.

###📊 Project Overview

Commuting behavior varies widely across individuals. This project answers questions such as:
- Do people with higher education tend to have longer or shorter commutes?
- How does income level affect commute time or travel mode?
- Are certain geographic areas associated with systematically higher commuting burdens?
- How do work hours interact with commute behavior?

The project uses large-scale U.S. microdata to identify statistical patterns and build interpretable models.

Education, income, and social status play significant roles in shaping commuting behaviors, influencing both the mode of transportation and the duration of commutes. Higher levels of education are often associated with greater job opportunities, which can lead to longer commutes as individuals seek employment in high-paying urban centers (Sage Journals, Springer). Income levels, on the other hand, affect commuting flexibility—wealthier individuals have greater access to private vehicles or premium public transit options, while lower-income workers may face longer, less efficient commutes due to reliance on public transportation and carpooling (WSJ, Economist). Social status and neighborhood income distribution further impact commuting efficiency, with wealthier areas having better infrastructure and transportation networks, whereas lower-income regions often experience inadequate transit options, reinforcing economic disparities (Economist, WSJ). Ultimately, these factors create a commuting landscape where privilege affords convenience, while socioeconomic constraints can exacerbate commuting burdens.
